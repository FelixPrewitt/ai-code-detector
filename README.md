AI Code Detector 🤖
Detecting AI-Generated vs Human-Written Code

The AI Code Detector is my first personal machine learning project, focused on understanding how models can distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code.
This project emphasizes fundamentals—data preprocessing, feature extraction, and experimentation—over model complexity.
