# AI Code Detector

## Detecting AI-Generated vs Human-Written Code

**Author:** Felix Prewitt

The AI Code Detector is a personal machine learning project that explores whether models can distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code using only the source code itself.

The project focuses on machine learning fundamentals—data preprocessing, feature extraction, dataset design, and experimentation—rather than model complexity. It is designed as a learning-first, portfolio project that emphasizes understanding model behavior and real-world limitations.

## What This Project Does

- Trains a machine learning model on labeled Python code snippets  
- Analyzes source code using character-level TF-IDF features  
- Evaluates how well authorship signals can be learned from isolated code  
- Investigates where ambiguity naturally limits detection accuracy

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- scikit-learn  
- TF-IDF (character-level n-grams)  
- VS Code
